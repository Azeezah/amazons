Amazons is a turnbased game, where the winner is the last player to move.  So you want to restrict your opponent's space until they cannot move.

Each player controls 4 amazons that move only in straight lines.

Whenever an amazon moves, she throws an arrow in a straight line.

Neither player can step on or over a square if an arrow has landed there.

Neither player can throw an arrow on or over a square if an arrow has already landed there.
